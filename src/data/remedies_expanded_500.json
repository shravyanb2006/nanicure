Rest helps the body heal.\n2) Keep hydrated: sip warm water, or a mild decoction like ginger-tulsi tea. Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (North India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 1)",

Rest helps the body heal.\n2) Keep hydrated: sip warm water, or a mild decoction like ginger-tulsi tea. Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (Central India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 3)",

Rest helps the body heal.\n2) Keep hydrated: sip warm water, or a mild decoction like ginger-tulsi tea. Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (West India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 5)",

Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (East India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 2)",

Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing.

Rest helps the body heal.\n2) Keep hydrated: sip warm water, or a mild decoction like ginger-tulsi tea. Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (South India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 3)",

Rest helps the body heal.\n2) Keep hydrated: sip warm water, or a mild decoction like ginger-tulsi tea. Small sips often are easier if nausea is present.\n3) Steam or warm compress where helpful: for chest congestion or blocked nose, steam inhalation with a towel can ease breathing. For muscle pain, use a warm compress.\n4) Simple kitchen helpers: use ginger, tulsi (holy basil), fennel, ajwain (carom seeds), cumin, lemon, and honey as mild home supports. Honey is not for infants under 1 year.\n5) Gentle topical care: for minor burns or cuts, cool with running water, apply clean aloe vera gel or a sterile dressing. For bruises, cold compress reduces swelling.\n6) Light movement and breathing: gentle stretching, walking in fresh air, and deep belly breaths calm the mind and improve circulation.\nRegional note (East India): Nani remembers local herbs often used there — try a small regional tweak if it suits you.\n(Nani tip variation 5)",
